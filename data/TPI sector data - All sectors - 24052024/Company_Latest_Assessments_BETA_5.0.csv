The company's target covers only Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The Scope 3 emissions intensity (Categories 10 and 11), which is not covered by the target, is assumed to remain constant from the latest year of disclosure. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector.

The company's target covers only Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The Scope 3 emissions intensity (Categories 10 and 11), which is not covered by the target, is assumed to remain constant from the latest year of disclosure. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector.

The carbon intensity has been (re-)calculated according to TPI methodology. The company has set targets to reduce its absolute emissions. To calculate the company's targeted emissions intensity, TPI has assumed that its externally sold products grow in line with the growth of the copper equivalent denominator in the National Pledges benchmark. This assessment includes the company's marketing business; we assume that this consists of physical trading and that the company's net zero target does not apply to its marketing business. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector.  When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions."

The carbon intensity has been (re-)calculated according to TPI methodology. The company has set targets to reduce its absolute emissions. To calculate the company's targeted emissions intensity, TPI has assumed that its externally sold products grow in line with the growth of the copper equivalent denominator in the National Pledges benchmark. The company's target covers only Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The Scope 3 emissions intensity (Categories 10 and 11), which is not covered by the target, is assumed to remain constant from the latest year of disclosure. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector. When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions."

Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions."

The carbon intensity has been (re-)calculated according to TPI methodology. The company has one or more intermediate targets that cover only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while its long-term target covers Scope 3 emissions. The emissions intensity for Scope 3 is linearly interpolated between the latest year of disclosure and the target year of the target that covers Scope 3. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector. When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions."

TPI’s benchmarks harmonise emissions under the EU’s Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). While formally adopted in September 2017, manufacturers systematically began reporting emission performance in WLTP in the reporting year 2020. We rely on conversion factors published by the ICCT to translate companies’ historical intensities from NEDC to WLTP, but previous assessments using NEDC are still accessible on our tool.

The carbon intensity has been (re-)calculated according to TPI methodology. The company has set targets to reduce its absolute emissions. To calculate the company's targeted emissions intensity, TPI has assumed that its externally sold products grow in line with the growth of the copper equivalent denominator in the National Pledges benchmark. The company's long-term target covers only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while it has an intermediate target for Scope 3 emissions. The Scope 3 emissions intensity (Categories 10 and 11), which is not covered by the long-term target, is assumed to remain constant from the target year of the intermediate target that covers Scope 3. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector. When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions."

We rely on conversion factors published by the ICCT to translate companies’ historical intensities from NEDC to WLTP, but previous assessments using NEDC are still accessible on our tool. When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions."
