The Scope 3 emissions intensity (Categories 10 and 11), which is not covered by the target, is assumed to remain constant from the latest year of disclosure. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance.

To calculate the company's targeted emissions intensity, TPI has assumed that its externally sold products grow in line with the growth of the copper equivalent denominator in the National Pledges benchmark. The company has one or more intermediate targets that cover only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while its long-term target covers Scope 3 emissions. The emissions intensity for Scope 3 is linearly interpolated between the latest year of disclosure and the target year of the target that covers Scope 3. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from diversified mining and compare the company's mining-specific pathway to TPI's mining-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company. Note as well that we do not currently have a Carbon Performance methodology for the coal mining sub-sector. When interpreting TPI Carbon Performance data, it is important to bear in mind that climate science shows temperature change is proportional to cumulative absolute CO2 emissions.",,,,56.70430419,54.01578353,40.42978047,44.15649795,47.84821129,32.47792853,31.84977734,31.22162616,30.59347497,29.96532379,29.3371726,28.70902141,28.08087023,27.45271904,26.82456785,26.03312117,25.24167448,24.45022779,23.65878111,22.86733442,22.07588773,21.28444104,20.49299436,19.70154767,18.91010098,,,,,,,,,,

In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from oil & gas production and compare the company's oil & gas pathway to TPI's oil & gas benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration.

Even though the company disclosed quantitative targets to reduce its emissions, TPI is unable to estimate the future Carbon Performance of the company due to the lack of historical data. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from cement production and compare the company's cement-specific pathway to TPI's cement-specific benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance. Note that TPI does not necessarily assess every business segment of a given company.

Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities.

The company’s target covers a subset of Scope 1, 2 and 3 (use of sold products) emissions. The emissions intensities of all emissions not covered by the target are assumed to remain constant from the level of the latest disclosure. Please note that this company operates in more than one sector assessed by TPI: we conduct a sector-specific assessment for each of the sectors in which a company operates. In this assessment, we evaluate only the emissions and production data from oil & gas production and compare the company's oil & gas pathway to TPI's oil & gas benchmarks. Other activities undertaken by this company are assessed separately, considering only the emissions and production data from those separate activities. Targets adopted by the company that are specific to a particular activity are incorporated into TPI's appropriate sector-specific assessment. We take a case-by-case approach to the interpretation of company-wide targets to evaluate whether targets can reasonably be assumed to apply in proportion to the emissions of the activity under consideration. Investors may want to consider all sector-specific assessments of a given company to understand its overall Carbon Performance.
